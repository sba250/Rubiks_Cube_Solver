By Shahar Bano and Ruvi Muskwe\
For CMPT 225, Data Structures and Programming - Fall 2025, Simon Fraser University

A Java implementation of a Rubik's Cube solver using the A* search algorithm with custom heuristics.

## Features
- A* Search Algorithm
- Custom heuristus that counts misplaced corners and edges with weighted penalties
- 3D Code Representation
- Move pruning removes redindant moves
- Memory Efficient
- Aims to solve the cube wihtin 10 seconds
